# APP-FORGE

**Automated Software Packaging for baramundi Management Suite**

---

## 🎯 The Story

As a baramundi partner without an MSW license (Managed Software), I faced the challenge of efficiently automating software packaging. Many baramundi customers worldwide know this problem - they use baramundi but cannot afford MSW, or they want to supplement their existing MSW installation with additional software.

**APP-FORGE bridges this gap.**

Developed by DADOiT, APP-FORGE automates the entire software lifecycle: from download to packaging, testing, and production release.
